# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). The aim is to build an accurate machine learning model that can help in early diagnosis and decision support in healthcare.

## 📂 Dataset

We are using the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/data855/heart-disease) from Kaggle. The dataset contains 918 observations and 12 features, including:

- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `ChestPainType`
- `Trestbps`
- `Cholesterol`
- `FastingBS`
- `RestingECG`
- `Thalach`
- `exang`
- `Oldpeak`
- `ST_Slope`
- `ca`
- `Thal`
- `Target`

## 📌 Objective

Predict whether a patient has heart disease (`Target = 1`) or not (`Target = 0`) based on clinical and lifestyle features.
